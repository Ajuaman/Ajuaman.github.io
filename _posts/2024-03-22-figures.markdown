## Introduction: Modern Conservative Commentators

There are some patterns I have observed among a lot of these convervative pro-capitalist influencers we see online, who seemingly have created a massive unfixable dent in the minds of young, influential students and children. I am referring not specifically to conservative academics, but the semi-laymen of conservatism who preach of traditional values. I am speaking of course about people such as Ben Shaprio, Steven Crowder, or perhaps even Charlie Kirk. These are people with extremely strong opinions about the trajectory of humanity and young conservatives, but whos methods are less about actual political thought and productive debate, and more about humiliating uneducated liberals publicly to support their conservative ideals. These people are neither academics nor honest people.
