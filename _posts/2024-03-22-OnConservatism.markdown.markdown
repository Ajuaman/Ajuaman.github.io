# Introduction

It is of no doubt that the state of the world has put many people in a state of anger, frustration and severe annoyance.
There is a feeling within our society that something is off. It is evident that some of us are beginning to realize more and more the disparities within our modern world; systemic racism, class disparities, anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment, outrageous propaganda, and a seemingly infinite amount of issues. At the heart of all these things, there is capitalism, the boogie man, manipulating our world not just on the physical level, but psychologically and spiritually. To preface this blog post, this is simply a criticism of the capitalist mode of production, and I speak in vague, broad generalizations. I am not suggesting any alternatives or other economic systems, we leave that to more qualified speakers.

## What Is Capitalism?

There are many different definitions of capitalism based on who a person speaks with. By the Marxist definition, capitalism is a socio-economic system that is characterized by private ownership of the so-called "means of production" (the ways in which we product e.g factories, farms, and land). This means that all of these farms and factories are owned by individuals or massive corporations rather than society as a whole.


## Marxian Terms and Definitions

It is important to clearly define various Marxist terms that will be used throughout this blog post. Below are some of the key terms

**Capital:** Refers to the accumulated wealth, resources, and means of production used in the process of capitalist production
\\
**Value:**  Refers to the value of a commodity determined the amount of socially necessary labor time required to produce it.

# How Capitalism Affects Us

## Capitalism and Racism (Racial Capitalism)

It is one of our true beliefs that at the heart of racism, there has always been capitalism. Therefore, it is a mistake to combat racism without combatting capitalism as well. As Marx pointed out, capital does not just appear out of nowhere, and in the past, it was developed through slave labour, mostly Black and African slaves. Marx called this concept "primitive accumulation". The slavery and exploitation of the past has had severe impacts on today's Black population, especially in the U.S. Slavery has clearly laid the foundation for systemic racism in the United States, with African Americans facing discrimination and prejudice in various aspects of life. This includes education, employment, housing, and criminal justice. The historical marginalization of African Americans has created enduring disparities in wealth, health outcomes, and social mobility.
